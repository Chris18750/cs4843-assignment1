## Website Structure
The website contains 5 pages created through HTML and contains multiple pictures and one video.

## S3
The project uses Amazon Web Services S3 web service to store the necessary files to display the web content. AWS S3 is a cloud object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve files from anywhere. The project uses this form of storage, becuase the website is a static website and AWS S3 allows simple storage and retrieval of these files. All the files listed in this github repository are hosted in a S3 bucket and can be retrieved to display the website.
